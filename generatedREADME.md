  ## Description 
  We built this application to help Junior Developers find their first job. As a lot of job sites focus on general developer jobs, we wanted to create one with a tailored approach. As Junior Developers browsing for jobs, we found that we had many tabs open with multiple job search engines. Therefore, we wanted to create an application specifically tailored to Junior Developers. The concept is to simplify the process, so that they can quickly find the information they need. We also noticed that there was a lack of a community for Junior Developers to interact, share issues, ask questions and gain career advice. We are currently implementing these features. During this project, we gained a better understanding of JS and how to work in an agile environment.

  ## Installation 

  Use the package manager [pip](https://example) to install the application.
