  ## Description 
  We built this project to help junior developers find their first job in the industry. As there are not many job sites offering a tailored approach, we decided to create a place where they could access this information. The concept is to simplify the process, so that they can quickly find the information they need. During this project, we became more comfortable using software such as Insomnia and making API calls.  We also noticed that there was a lack of a community for Junior Developers to interact, share issues, ask questions and gain career advice. We are currently implementing these features.
